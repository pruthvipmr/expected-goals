# Expected Goals Model

The aim of this project is to develop an expected goals model from soccer shots data. Expected goals or xG is essentially the probability of a shot to result in a goal.

# Data
The dataset used is the [Statsbomb Women's Soccer Open Data](https://github.com/j-v-n/open-data). Only the events data from this dataset is used in this project. Events data describes all the events that occurred in a match. The specific events of interest in this project are shots and any key passes prior to shots.

# Notebooks
The notebooks are, in order of the project flow:
  - data_wrangling.ipynb
  - data_storytelling.ipynb
  - statistical_inference.ipynb
  - predictive_model_selection.ipynb
  - model_application.ipynb
